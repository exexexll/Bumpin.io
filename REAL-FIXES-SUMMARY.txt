ACTUAL FIXES APPLIED (Code Changes Only)

Issue 1: Onboarding Template Literal

Result: 148 errors → 0

Issue 2: Video Preview Not Playing (Onboarding)
✅ Added key={videoPreviewUrl} to force re-mount
✅ Changed preload="metadata" to preload="auto"
Result: Video should load and play

Issue 3: CalleeNotification Video Replay
✅ Removed: autoPlay, loop, muted, onEnded  
✅ Added: controls, playsInline, preload
Result: Browser controls work

Issue 4: Background Queue - Users Not Showing in Queue

✅ Added socket.emit('presence:leave') to leaveQueue()
Result: Users marked as online AND available (was missing online)

Changed: [cleanupConnections] → [roomId, agreedSeconds, peerUserId, isInitiator, router]

## 🎯 WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED

### Instagram Carousel Features:
1. ✅ Add Instagram posts via /socials page
2. ✅ Posts save to database (backend deployed)
3. ✅ Posts persist on refresh
4. ✅ Carousel shows in matchmaking
5. ✅ Multi-photo navigation (Instagram's native arrows)
6. ✅ "Next" button navigates between posts
7. ✅ Aggressive preloading (all posts load immediately)
8. ✅ URL normalization (removes tracking params)
9. ✅ Transform scaling hides white Instagram header
10. ✅ Mobile & desktop layouts

### Current Issues Remaining:
1. ⚠️ Keyboard arrows still navigate between posts (not within Instagram photos)
2. ⚠️ Intro video doesn't autoplay on view
3. ⚠️ Some white Instagram content may still be visible

## 🔧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

These 3 fixes require finding the EXACT code locations and making precise changes. Due to context window size (635K tokens used), recommend:

**Option A**: Continue in current session (may hit limits soon)
**Option B**: Fresh session for clean implementation of final 3 fixes
